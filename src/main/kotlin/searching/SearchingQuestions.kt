	//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS

	//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (DFS will take to much time)

	//If the tree is very wide: DFS

	//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

	//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

	//Finding the shortest path: BFS
